# Getting started with Howler.js
_Enhance your apps with simple audio feedback_

This is the demo for a tech talk I gave at Fullstack Academy of Code about simple ways to get started with Howler.js for non-musicians.

## Running this repo locally
After you fork and clone the repo, run `bower install`.

To run the demo, you will need a server. I recommend `http-server`, running it from inside of the repo directory:
```
npm install -g http-server

http-server
```

By default, `http-server` will listen on `localhost:8080`.
